                Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic
                drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall
                after water and tea.Beer is brewed from cereal grainsâ€”most
                commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and
                rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of
                the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation
                in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops,
                which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural
                preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such
                as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of
                hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is
                often removed during processing and replaced with forced
                carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to
                the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi
                included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and "The Hymn
                to Ninkasi", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer,
                served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the
                recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Beer is
                distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available
                on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry
                is a global business, consisting of several dominant
                multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers
                ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of
                modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (ABV),
                although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries
                creating examples of 40% ABV and above.[11] Beer forms part of
                the culture of many nations and is associated with social
                traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture
                involving activities like pub crawling and pub games.
